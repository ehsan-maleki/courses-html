                <u> During the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States on</u><strong><em>
                January 20,
                2021</em></strong>, Gaga sang the US national anthem.[232] In February 2021, her dog walker Ryan Fischer
                was
                hospitalized after getting shot in Hollywood. Two of her French Bulldogs, Koji and Gustav, were taken
                while a third
                dog named Miss Asia escaped and was subsequently recovered by police. Gaga later offered a $500,000
                reward for the
                return of her pets.[233][234] Two days later, on February 26, a woman brought the dogs to a police
                station in Los
                Angeles. Both were unharmed. Los Angeles Police initially said the woman who dropped off the dogs did
                not appear to
                be involved with the shooting,[235] but on April 29, she was one of five people charged in connection
                with the
                shooting and theft.[236]

                nfter Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a <em> songwriter </em>for Sony/ATV Music
                Publishing,
                where she
                signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Akon's label, KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga rose
                to prominence
                the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles "Just Dance" and
                "Poker
                Face".</p>
            <p>The album was later reissued to include the EP The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful
                singles "Bad
                Romance", "Telephone", and "Alejandro".
            </p>
            <p align="justify"> Gaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second
                full-length album, Born This
                Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first
                week. The
                title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less
                than a
                week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), and its lead single "Applause", Gaga
                released the
                jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and the soft rock album Joanne (2016). She also
                ventured into
                acting, playing leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015–2016), for which she
                received a
                Golden Globe Award for Best Actress, and the critically acclaimed musical drama film A Star Is Born
                (2018). Her
                contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single "Shallow", made her the
                first woman
                to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award, and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to
